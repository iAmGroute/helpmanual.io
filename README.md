# Categories:

* `commands` - eg. things installed with `apt`
* `builtins` - eg. `compgen -b`
* pypi
* npm
* perhaps other packages managers eg. PHP, CRAN.
* specific commands git, docker, sublime, atom, aws, dropbox

# TODO

1. improve homepage
2. add search
3. tinker with UI
4. add json ld
5. add more sources, particularly builtins
6. links between pages
7. full build command with vagrant

# Processing pipeline

To generate documents:

## 1. Install raw

**Skipped for now, we just use what's installed on the system.**

This will be:
* `apt install ...`
* `pip install ...`
* `npm install ...`
* specific command installs

## 2. Collect raw data

Eg. collect static files into `./raw`.

#### for man

This is simply coping and extracting. See `extract_man()`.

#### for executable commands

Run `compgen -c`, check if the command is included in `compgen -b`, apt, pip or npm installed packages.

This requires the commands to be executed with ` --help` and ` --version`,
the output can then be collected.


## 3. Update metadata

Need one metadata file summarizing what's installed and collected, but also updated here.

**Need some way of avoiding custom data being overwritten by auto generation.**

This to include in metadata:
* name
* description
* version, might end up with multiple
* source eg. apt or npm, man and man type
* data eg. man, help, version, bare call
* date generated
* data written
* author
* website
* command - used to link `compgen` to source
* path inside `./raw`
* uri
* path to any extra data for this package.
* sub commands: git, docker, apt
* perhaps some way to control cross page links

## 4. Generate html content

This is not the full page, just the content specific to each package.

Should include:
* prepare data for search index
* prepare data for sitemap.xml
* inserting links between documents

We might want to persist this data in VCS for performance and for different versions.

## 5. Generate final html pages

Create pretty HTML, not saved just sent to server, should include search index and sitemap.xml
